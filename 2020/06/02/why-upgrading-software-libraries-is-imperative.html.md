Stack applications primarily consist of the Operating System as well as front and backend programming languages including their necessary list of library packages. The Operating System and programming language software can be periodically updated and run on the latest version. However, what about the long list of libraries being used in the application’s front and backend? As we know, It can be quite daunting to maintain and individually update a long list of software libraries. Still, it is important to keep them updated in several ways while mitigating the level of complexity. This post dives into our experience upgrading a complex stack with a list of libraries. What you will need, how to go about it, and the benefits of such an activity are all examined below. 

The application stack in question contained decade-old software and included extensive libraries when we received it from our client. The application consisted of languages including Java, Scala, Kotlin and JavaScript in tandem with an extensive list of libraries. The initial plan was to upgrade the complete stack all at once due to the gap between versions. This proved to be more difficult than expected due to a host of deprecated and removed functionalities in addition to their inter-dependency on a few of the libraries. 

### Conflict Approach
Speaking on upgrading libraries and dependencies,it is often said: “don't update unless you have to.” For the short term, this can be sustainable, however, not as much in the long run. Primarily, the updates protect from known vulnerabilities and cyber attacks. Scenarios arise where particular library fixes are implemented on the latest version, yet require upgrading other libraries to the latest version in a chain. Because an upgraded list of libraries needs complete testing and preparation for new issues, this directly impacts whether the application attempts to resolve an issue. Therefore, smaller and more frequent updates are more sustainable in the long run. Larger and more infrequent upgrades will not only result in unexpected errors, but also require regress testing to deliver a version free of error. The following points justify the necessity of software and library upgrades:

* Apply timely security patches to reduce vulnerabilities and defend from cyberattack
* Identify deprecated functionality earlier and use alternatives
* Remain on your Long Term Support (LTS) version
* Apply fixes on known bugs in the library

### Benefits
New versions of software libraries are periodically released which means the latest release superior to the former. Why don’t we make use of the better version when it is available. It is recommended to keep those softwares and libraries updated to get benefits such as bug fixes, new features, boosted performance, improvements on stability, compatibility, and security measures. Most of the time software/libraries upgraded are ignored in projects due to very minimal effects in appearance. However frequent updates deliver benefits which clearly demonstrate the importance of upgrading software libraries.

### Real Time Difficulties
In real-life scenarios, bug fixes and performance optimization of the application become a higher priority than upgrading libraries. In many cases, this results in a time discrepancy between the library’s version in application and the latest version upgrade. This discrepancy can lead to the following issues:

* Unexpected error handling in new releases
* Unexpected unsupported library dependency error
* Complete end-to-end automated testing on library upgrade
* Lack of demonstration of work being done can lead to a lack of confidence from client
* Difficulty in estimatimating workload due to expectation of major unexpected errors

The following passages offer guidance in how to adequately prepare for these issues.  

### Get Prepared
While much can be learned from a major upgrade on both a business and technical level, being prepared for such an endeavor is imperative. First, a complete list of libraries from the entire application should be compiled. The list should include the latest and current version of the library in the application. Reviewing the changelog of both versions will help identify potential non-compatibility or error scenarios. Visiting the “issue report page” of the library to monitor any version-specific issues is also recommended. Once the libraries are adequately prepared for upgrading, any method of your choosing can be utilized to upgrade and maintain the list. Once the road map is established, upgrading can commence and any compatibility issues that arise can be dealt with in real time. Finally, thorough end-to-end testing is necessary after the upgrade process is complete.

### Recommendations:
Once the application stack software and libraries are up-to-date with the latest version, it is important to regularly update. The complete upgrade experience can be a rigorously involved process that includes juggling numerous issues and intensive testing. Additionally, from a client’s perspective, a major upgrade project doesn’t obviously demonstrate improvement to appearance or function. Because it is not recommended to keep outdated software and major upgrades (such as the one described above) are tedious, the following update options are preferable in order to keep software libraries as up-to-date as possible:

* Interval Based - Particular interval periods are implemented to check versions of softwares and libraries. This minimises frequency of errors while ensuring a minimal gap between the current and latest software version. 
* Module Based - Whenever work is performed on any module for new features or bug fixes, software and libraries versions are reviewed. This allows for relevant libraries to be updated, tested, and deployed along with development changes within the module.

### Conclusion
Even if new features and improvements of the libraries are not as pertinent to the new release, frequent upgrades to software and libraries are crucial in order to ensure the most secure and debugged versions. The approaches mentioned above suggest a plan that will, above all else, help maintain the updates of software libraries. With security as highest priority, these upgrades are not only imperative, but unavoidable. You are welcome to share your methods of approach when upgrading software libraries.
